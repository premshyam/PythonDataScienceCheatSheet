# Hypothesis Testing

## Concepts

### Null and Alternate

Hypothesis Testing starts with the formulation of these two hypotheses:

**Null hypothesis** (H₀): The status quo

**Alternate hypothesis** (H₁): The challenge to the status quo

| Hypothesis | Symbols |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Null       | =, ≤, ≥ |
| Alternate  | ≠, >, < |

### Decision Making

You can tell the type of the test and the position of the critical region on the basis of the ‘sign’ in the alternate hypothesis.

| Sign in H₁ | TestType          | Rejection Region           |
| ---------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| ≠          | Two-tailed test   | both sides of distribution |
| <          | Lower-tailed test | left side of distribution  |
| >          | Upper-tailed test | right side of distribution |

### Critical Value Method
