# Inferential Statistics

## Permutations

### order matters

1. Arrangement of n distinct object is n!
2. selecting r object from a total of n objects nPr = n!/(n-r)!
3. **keywords:** order/arrange

## Combinations

### order doesn't matter

1. select r objects from a total of n objects nCr = n!/(n-r)!r! = nPr/r!
2. **keywords:** pick/choose

## Probability

1. Probability = (No. of desired outcomes)/(Total outcomes)
2. Total Probability = 1
3. Probability of an event rangs from 0-1

### Experiment

1. Deterministic
2. Random

### Sample Space

1. Given a random experiment K, a set of all possible outcomes for K represents the sample space

### Event

1. Subset of the sample space

## Types of Events

1. Independent events
2. Disjoint or mutually exclusive events (complement rule of probability applies) P(A)+P(A')=1

## Rules of Probability

1. Addition P(A u B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A n B) or P(A)+P(B ) if A and B are disjoint **keywords:** OR to denote the relationship between events

2. Multiplication P(A and B) = P(A)\*P(B) if A and B are independent events extending the rule P(A and B and C and D) = P(A)*P(B)*P(C)\*P(D) **keywords:** AND to denote the relationship between events
